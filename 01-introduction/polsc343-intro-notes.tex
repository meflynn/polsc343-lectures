\begin{itemize}
\item
  Introduce myself
\item
  Talk about my research interests

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    US Foreign Policy
  \item
    Military deployments
  \item
    Partisanship and ideology
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  International relations affects your day to day life in so many ways

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Trade, migration, and investment: Touch your computer, clothes, etc.
    Some of this, if not all, was made overseas! Envision the hands of
    someone working in a Taiwanese factory making your iphone or your
    computer.
  \item
    War and conflict: We live really close to two of the most important
    military installations in the US. Many of you may also have family
    who are affected by war and conflict through military service
  \item
    Global governance: Watching how the US and the world have responded
    to the COVID pandemic is a lesson in global governance. Science,
    technology, and policy communications evolve at an incredible rate,
    and sharing that information between governmental and private actors
    is incredibly important in responding to a pandemic like COVID.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{class-information}{%
\section{Class information}\label{class-information}}

First I want to go over some basic information about the course with you

Specifics

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Talk about COVID: I'd rather be doing this in person, but I think this
  is the safest thing we can do right now.
\item
  There's still a lot that we don't know, and the assumption that
  uncertainty is going to break in our favor is a pretty strong one.
\item
  Office hours are by appointment, but don't let that discourage you
\item
  I'm always willing to make time to talk to students
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{contact}{%
\section{Contact}\label{contact}}

Reiterate this point. I'm always available and happy to talk!

\hypertarget{contact-etiquette}{%
\section{Contact Etiquette}\label{contact-etiquette}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  That said, I do expect correspondence to be professional in tone.
\item
  This holds for all different faculty and staff
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{stuff-you-need}{%
\section{Stuff you need}\label{stuff-you-need}}

Intro slide

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Read the syllabus. All of the course details are there and it should
  answer most of your basic questiosn about the course.
\item
  This is going to be a mix of lecture and group-based discussion
\item
  Readings

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Talk about why I chose these books
  \item
    Immerwahr provides a really unique perspective on US foreign policy.
    He covers a lot of material that other historians have covered, but
    he's up front about this. His biggest contribution is framing the
    question.
  \item
    Brooks similarly brings a lot of information to her discussion of
    the contemporary US military, but a lot of this is also synthesized
    from other sources. Still, she threads a variety of different topics
    together in a really clear and concise way.
  \item
    Cooley and Nexon is a new book and I haven't had a chance to read it
    yet. But they both do a lot of work on the international system,
    what it looks like, and how it functions. There's been a growing
    debate about the United States' status as a global hegemon, and this
    book tries to look at the US' current place in the international
    system, the challenges it faces, and what's likely to be ahead.
  \item
    There are also a bunch of different articles that relate to the
    weekly topics. I tried to find a mix of casual general audience
    readings, but also social scientific material, too.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{requirements}{%
\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}}

Here's the breakdown of your grades

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Weekly discussion will be the meat and potatoes. You'll get together
  in small groups of 6-7 students, each student will have a role for a
  given week, and you'll cycle through those roles each week so everyone
  gets to engage with different aspects of the readings.
\item
  There will also be short weekly quizzes. Each week you'll have a short
  reading assignment in addition to the normal weekly readings, then
  you'll have to complete a short 5-6 question quiz on that reading
  assignment.
\item
  The weekly blog is designed to be more individually focused. You'll
  choose a broad topic area at the beginning of the semester (like
  alliances) and write a short weekly reflection piece on a news article
  related to that topic.
\item
  The music of foreign policy wiki

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Talk about the arts and politics
  \item
    Talk about my own experience with music and politics
  \item
    The goal here is to have a longer-arc project that will help
    students dig into the political events underlying popular music
  \item
    You can find more information in the syllabus
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{academics-dishonesty-and-plagiarism}{%
\section{Academics dishonesty and
plagiarism}\label{academics-dishonesty-and-plagiarism}}

Don't do it!

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The consequences can be serious
\item
  Theres a lot more information in the syllabus so check it out.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classroom-conduct}{%
\section{Classroom Conduct}\label{classroom-conduct}}

Expectations

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Be kind: This is a particularly tough time for everyone, and we may
  not always see the ways our classmates are struggling.
\item
  Be thoughtful: Please make sure questions and comments pertain to the
  course material. Spouting off about some half-baked political belief
  isn't the same thing as offering up a careful comment of hypothesis.
\item
  Reach out if you need help!
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{big-picture}{%
\section{Big Picture}\label{big-picture}}

Some thoughts on the overarching takeaways of the course

There are a few big topics that we'll cover over the next few months,
but there are four ``big ideas'' that I want you to start thinking about

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The national interest:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Something you hear a lot about
  \item
    A really bad term
  \item
    Different individuals and groups have different interests and
    preferences.
  \item
    Foreign policy affects these individual and groups differently
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Politics stops at the water's edge

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Similar to the national interest, this piece of conventional wisdom
    asserts that foreign policy is ``above'' or immunite to politics,
    but the reality couldn't be further from the truth Everything is
    political--even foreign policy.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Isolationism vs internationalism

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Policymakers and pundits often like to distill options or groups
    down into competing camps, and this is a really common one
  \item
    True ``isolationism'' is really, really rare outside places like
    Feudal Japan.
  \item
    Even people labeled as isolationists in US foreign policy are
    rarely, if ever, advocating a complete severing of ties with the
    outside world.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Grand Strategy

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    This one is less common in the public sphere, but it's really
    important
  \item
    There's a belief that if only the US had the right ``plan'' it could
    succeed in ``X'' scenario
  \item
    Reality is more difficult
  \item
    Focus on the broad global conditions ignores context-specific
    incidents
  \item
    It also tends to portray the situation as a decision-theoretic one
    in which the US is the only actor making choices, \emph{not} as a
    strategic actor in a world of other strategic actors.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I hope this introduction covered most of your questions. But if you
  still have questions about the material, and it's not covered in the
  syllabus, please email me!
\end{itemize}
